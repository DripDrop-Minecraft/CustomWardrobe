## 项目简介 | Introduction

本项目基于 [GioSDA/Wardrobe](https://github.com/GioSDA/Wardrobe) ，采用Kotlin全面重构开发，为 DripDrop Minecraft 服务器进行专门定制。

Based on [GioSDA/Wardrobe](https://github.com/GioSDA/Wardrobe), this project is refactored and redeveloped completely with Kotlin,
 and specially customized for Minecraft server DripDrop.

之所以要全面重构开发，是因为源项目没有提交任何跟编译环境相关的文件，并且代码十分混乱，难以在此基础上继续开展工作。为了能够更好地进行开发维护的工作，
只能创建新项目，在审查源项目代码的同时，对其进行重构开发。

I have to refactor the source project because it doesn't contain any file that relative with compiling or building, 
such as build.gradle and settings.gradle, that is one reason. Another reason, code of the source project is so terrible.
Jesus, I have no idea what other developers' feelings are when they read the source code XD.
